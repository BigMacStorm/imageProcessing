Image processing homework, three problems with three solutions.

1. [25 pts] Image Sampling
Write a program to change the spatial resolution to 128 x 128, 64 x 64, and 32 x 32 pixels.
Resize the images back to the original size 256 x 256 images and print them for comparison
purposes. Explain how your algorithm works.


2. [25 pts] Image Quantization
Write a program that would reduce the number of gray levels in a PGM image from 256 to:
(i) 128, (ii) 32, (iii) 8, and (iv) 2. Explain how your algorithm works.


3. [50 pts] Histogram Equalization
(a) Write a program to compute the histogram of an image.
(b) Implement the histogram equalization technique. It is suggest that you debug your
algorithm using a small “test” image (e.g., 5 x 5) to make sure that it works correctly.
(c) Perform histogram equalization on the “boat” and “f_16” images.
(d) Show and discuss your results (i.e., original images/histograms, output
images/histograms).
